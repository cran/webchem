webchem 0.0.4.0
======================

NEW FEATURES

* chemid() to query ChemIDplus http://chem.sis.nlm.nih.gov/chemidplus/.
* is.inchikey() and is.cas() to check if a string is valid inchikey or CAS registry number.
* parse_mol(): A simple molfile parser.
* Functions to work with ChemSpider InChI API:
  + cs_csid_mol() : convert csid to mol
  + cs_inchikey_csid() : convert inchikey to csid
  + cs_inchikey_inchi() : convert inchikey to inchi
  + cs_inchikey_mol() : convert inchikey to Molfile
  + cs_inchi_csid() : convert inchi to csid
  + cs_inchi_inchikey : convert inchi to inchikey
  + cs_inchi_mol() : convert inchi to molfile
  + cs_inchi_smiles() : convert inchi to smiles
  + cs_smiles_inchi() : convert smiles to inchi
  + These are all wrapped into cs_convert()
  + is.inchikey_cs() : Check via ChemSpider if inchikey is valid
* webchem has now a zenodo doi, please cite if you use it.


MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* cts_compinfo() checks if input is a inchikey (via exported function is.inchikey()).
* cts_compinfo() is now more robust and verbose, if problems are encountered
* alanwood() returns separate inchi and ichikeys in case of isomers.
* alanwood() returns also subactvity (e.g. $Fluazinam$activity [1] "fungicides" and $Fluazinam$subactivity [1] "pyridine fungicides").
* physprop() also returns boiling and melting points. Moreover, values are now numeric.


BUG FIXES

* alanwood() returns only results for first match in case of multiple links found
* physprop() stopped working after change of SRC to https, fixed now.
* changed etox_* functions to https


DEPRECATED FUNCTIONS

* ppdb() replaces ppdb_query() and accepts individual index as created by ppdb_buildidx().
* cir() replaces cir_query().
* cs_compinfo() replaces csid_compinfo()
* cs_extcompinfo() replaces csid_extcompinfo()


DEFUNCT FUNCTIONS

* allanwood()




webchem 0.0.3
======================

NEW FEATURES

* Query SRC PHYSPROP Database with physprop().
* Query the ETOX ID with get_etoxid(); query basic information with etox_basic();
  quality targets with etox_targets() and test results with etox_tests().
* Query PPDB with ppdb_query()

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* added exceptions/checks to tests
* improved robustness of cir_query()

BUG FIXES

* Correct the spelling of Alan Wood and rename function allanwood() to alanwood() [contribition of @jranke]



webchem 0.0.2
======================

NEW FEATURES

* Query the PAN Pesticides Database with pan().
* Query Allan Woods Compendium of Pesticide Common Names with allanwood().

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Added checks for user input.
* Fixed documentation, added example for bulk processing.
* cts_convert() returns NA if no result was found.
* Set 'verbose = TRUE' as default for all functions.
* Added unit tests.
* All functions return silently NA, if API is not reachable.

BUG FIXES

* cts_convert() does not ignore 'first' argument.
* get_csid() did not return NA, if there was a problem with the API.
* Many functions returned 'NA2+' if NA was given - now return NA by default.
* Many fixes in NA handling, e.g. when no hit was found.
